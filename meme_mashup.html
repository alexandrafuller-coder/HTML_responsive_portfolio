<h1> Module 2: Meme Mashup Video </h1>
<p> We've all done things that feel good in the moment and come back to bite us later. For my meme mashup, I wanted to combine a few of my favorite memes, like silly cat reactions, Minecraft sound effects, and referring to yourself as a queen to tell a story about in the moment indulgence leading to bad consequences down the line. I've always liked memes a lot, since I feel like it's a nonchalant way for people to communicate raw feelings with each other and experiment with art like video editing. I kept the story simple and down to earth to really capture that feeling. </p>
