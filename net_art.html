<h1> Module 4: Narrative Net Art Website </h1>
<p> For my net art project, I wanted to draw upon the story I'm writing for my advanced screenwriting class. It's about a grad student in the early 2000's who runs a horror blog who comes across the story of the death of a paranormal investigator who was hunting down a tape that supposedly killed anyone who watched it. I wanted to capture the basics of the story and recreate the eerie feeling I'm trying to capture within the story as the paranormal investigator's spirit begins to reach out to the main character to warn her to stop delving into his story before bad things happen.  </p>
