<h1> Module 3: 3D Render and Animation </h1>
<p> For my 3D render, I kept the objects very simple in order to fully explore Blender and get the hang of the basics. I found a wooden log, unicorn, and wheelbarrow 3D model, added them to the blender file, and then played around with the textures and colors. My goal with this project was to have a living creature and two inanimate objects with three different textures, even if they weren't rendered spectacularly.  </p>
